Change the opacity of any window (Windows)
I provide you the raw .ahk file and also provide you the .exe conversion (Base File version is in the filename, if you dont know what it is: This script runs on AutoHotkey Version: v1.1.37.02 32-bit).
If you haven't installed AutoHotkey you can just use the .exe and enjoy it, there is no need to install AutoHotkey that way.

If you want it integrate into your startup so you dont want to execute it everytime follow these steps:

1) Press Win + R
2) Type "shell:startup"
3) Put the file in it
4) Enjoy.
